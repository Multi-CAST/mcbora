## Description


**Bora** ([bora1263](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/bora1263)) Bora is a Boran language spoken in various small communities in the Colombian and Peruvian Amazon region (e.g. 3.23°S 71.99°W, 1.75°S 72.50°W). The language has approximately 1 000 speakers, almost all of whom are bilingual in local Spanish. The number of children acquiring Bora is currently decreasing.

Bora has been extensively documented within a VolkswagenStiftung-funded [DOBES documentation project](https://hdl.handle.net/1839/42550453-b3db-4d83-b30f-3bce5304588e) (2005–2009). The Multi-CAST Bora corpus consists of two folkloristic narrative texts taken from the larger DOBES collection. They were recorded and annotated by Frank Seifart in collaboration with, especially, Clever Panduro (original transcription and translation) and Lena Sell (original morphological glossing). Annotations with GRAID and RefIND were added to the corpus in 2021–2022 by Tai Hong in collaboration with Frank Seifart.

The Multi-CAST Bora texts (version 2207) also constitute a part of the [Bora data set](https://doreco.huma-num.fr/languages/bora1263) in [DoReCo](https://doreco.huma-num.fr/), which has been time-aligned at the phone level.
